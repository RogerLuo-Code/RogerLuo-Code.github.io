So the number of combinations increases to \\(10 \\times 10 \\times 10 \\times 10 = 10000\\) since there are \\(10\\) options for each digit.</p> <p>Later someone remembers that the order of numbers doesn't matter. Then we are dealing with combinations. The number of combinations is reduced to $$ C(10, 4) = \\frac{10!}{4! (10 - 4)!} = 210 $$ The number is much lower to deal with.</p> <p>Further reading: Permutations and combinations</p>"},{"location":"blog/archive/2024/","title":"2024","text":""},{"location":"blog/category/math-is-fun/","title":"Math is Fun","text":""}]}
